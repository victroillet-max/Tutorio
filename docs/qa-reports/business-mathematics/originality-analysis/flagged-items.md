## Detailed Verification

### Category 1: Numerical Examples

| Example Type | Tutorio Value | EHL Reference | Verdict |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Hotel room count | 150 rooms | Varies | ORIGINAL |
| Occupied rooms | 87 rooms | N/A | ORIGINAL |
| Restaurant bill | CHF 392 | N/A | ORIGINAL |
| Party size | 8 people | N/A | ORIGINAL |
| CEO salary outlier | CHF 250,000 | N/A | ORIGINAL |
| Room rates | 150, 180, 165, 200, 175 | Different | ORIGINAL |
| Occupancy percentages | 78, 82, 95, 88, 72, 91, 85 | N/A | ORIGINAL |
| Investment amounts | CHF 10,000 / 20,000 | N/A | ORIGINAL |

### Category 2: Company/Context Names

| Used in Tutorio | Similar in EHL? | Issue? |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Generic "hotel" | No specific match | NO |
| Generic "restaurant" | No specific match | NO |
| Generic "company" | No specific match | NO |
| Generic "business" | No specific match | NO |

**No EHL-specific company names or case studies used.**

### Category 3: Problem Structures

| Problem Type | Format Similar? | Values Original? | Verdict |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Integer addition | Universal | Yes | PASS |
| Percentage calculations | Universal | Yes | PASS |
| Compound interest | Universal | Yes | PASS |
| Break-even analysis | Universal | Yes | PASS |
| Mean calculations | Universal | Yes | PASS |
| Derivative problems | Universal | Yes | PASS |

**Standard mathematical problem formats with original numerical values.**

### Category 4: Formulas

| Formula | Source | Copyrightable? |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Mean = Sum/n | Standard math | NO |
| Compound Interest A = P(1+r/n)^nt | Standard finance | NO |
| Derivative power rule | Standard calculus | NO |
| Integral power rule | Standard calculus | NO |

**All formulas are standard mathematical notation and cannot be copyrighted.**

### Category 5: Explanations and Prose

**Verification Method:** Compared explanation phrasing against EHL slides.

| Topic | Tutorio Phrasing | EHL Phrasing | Match? |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Order of operations | "Whatever you do to one side..." | Different wording | NO |
| Sign rules | "Same signs = positive..." | Different presentation | NO |
| Weighted average | "Not all values should count equally" | Different context | NO |

**All explanations are independently written.**

## Hospitality Context Usage

### Assessment

Both EHL and Tutorio use hospitality examples (hotels, restaurants) because:
1. EHL is a hospitality school
2. Tutorio is designed for EHL students
3. Business math concepts are best illustrated with industry-relevant examples

### Distinction

| Aspect | EHL Materials | Tutorio Materials |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Hotel names | Sometimes specific | Always generic |
| Room numbers | Specific to examples | Different values |
| Revenue figures | Case-specific | Original values |
| Context details | From real cases | Fictional scenarios |

**Using hospitality context is appropriate and expected. The specific examples are original.**

---

## Currency Usage

### CHF (Swiss Francs)

- **Usage:** All monetary examples use CHF
- **Reason:** Target audience is Swiss business students
- **Issue:** None - currency is public domain
- **VAT Rate:** 7.7% used (current Swiss rate) - factual information

---

## Recommendations

### Current Status: COMPLIANT

No changes required for originality compliance.

### Best Practices for Future Content

1. Continue using original numerical values
2. Avoid copying specific EHL case study names
3. Create fictional company names if needed
4. Ensure all examples use values not found in EHL materials

---

## Certification

This analysis certifies that the Business Mathematics course content:

1. Uses original numerical examples throughout
2. Contains no copied text from EHL reference materials
3. Employs standard mathematical formulas (not copyrightable)
4. Uses hospitality context appropriately with original scenarios
5. Poses no intellectual property risks

**Originality Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**
