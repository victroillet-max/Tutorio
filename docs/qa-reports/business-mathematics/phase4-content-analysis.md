## Originality Analysis Summary

### Examples Verified as ORIGINAL

| Category | Sample | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Hotel examples | 150 rooms, 87 occupied | Original (EHL uses different numbers) |
| Restaurant bills | CHF 392 for 8 people | Original scenario |
| Salary outliers | CHF 250,000 CEO | Original values |
| Room rates | CHF 150, 180, 165, 200, 175 | Original dataset |

## Struggling Student Assessment

### What Works Well

1. **Step-by-Step Tables:** Every complex concept broken into numbered steps
2. **Warning Boxes:** "Common Mistake" callouts prevent typical errors
3. **Memory Tricks:** Mnemonics provided (PEMDAS, "Same signs = positive")
4. **Business Context:** Real-world applications make abstract math concrete
5. **Feedback Quality:** Quiz explanations explain the "why" not just "correct/incorrect"

### Areas for Improvement

1. **More Visual Diagrams:** Number lines and graphs could be more graphical
2. **Video Content:** Some concepts would benefit from video walkthroughs
3. **Practice Quantity:** Some skills have only 3-4 activities (target is 5+)
4. **Remedial Paths:** No explicit "try again with simpler example" paths

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Course Release)

1. Add logarithm activities (Basics + Rules) - EHL Ch3 coverage
2. Add quadratic equation activities - EHL Ch4 coverage
3. Ensure all skills have minimum 5 activities

### Near-Term Actions (Within 30 days)

1. Add partial derivatives content - EHL Ch9 coverage
2. Add chain rule activities - differentiation completeness
3. Create consumer/producer surplus activities - integration application

### Long-Term Actions (Within 90 days)

1. Add video explanations for complex topics
2. Create adaptive remedial paths
3. Add more analyze/evaluate level activities

## Final Verdict

| Criterion | Score | Threshold | Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4.2/5 | 4.0/5 | PASS |
| Originality | 4.0/5 | 3.0/5 | PASS |
| Curriculum Coverage | 51% | 80% | FAIL |
| Activity Quantity | 72 | 235 (5x47) | FAIL |
| Struggling Student Support | 4.3/5 | 4.0/5 | PASS |

**Overall Status: CONDITIONAL PASS**

The existing content is high-quality and original, but significant gaps remain in:
1. Advanced topics (logarithms, chain rule, partial derivatives)
2. Activity quantity per skill
3. Curriculum completeness
