## 4. Originality Guidelines

### MUST BE ORIGINAL (not derived from EHL materials)
- All numerical examples
- All company names and scenarios
- All practice problems and exercises
- Code samples (if any)
- Diagrams and visuals
- Explanation phrasing and analogies

### CAN MATCH EHL MATERIALS
- Topic sequence and coverage
- Learning objectives
- Concept definitions (mathematical facts)
- Formula presentations (standard mathematical formulas)
- Skill progression

### FLAGGED ITEMS (to check during Phase 4)
Items to specifically verify are NOT copied from EHL:
1. Hotel/hospitality examples (EHL-specific context)
2. Swiss franc (CHF) currency examples
3. Specific percentage values used in examples
4. Company names from class exercises
5. Dataset values from problem sets

---

## 5. Notes for QA Agent

1. **PDF files cannot be read directly** - content comparison will be done by reviewing Tutorio activities and flagging any that appear to use EHL-specific examples or terminology.

2. **Hospitality context is expected** - since EHL is a hospitality school, any examples using hotels, restaurants, or tourism that closely match EHL style should be flagged.

3. **Mathematical formulas are universal** - standard formulas like the quadratic formula, compound interest formula, or derivative rules are not subject to originality concerns.

4. **Focus areas for originality check:**
   - Chapter 2 exercises (E2-3, E2-4, P2-11, P2-17, P2-18)
   - Bonus exercises (may have unique problem formats)
   - Midterm exam problems

*This index will be updated during Phase 4 as specific content is reviewed.*
